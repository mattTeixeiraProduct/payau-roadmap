# Migration Complete! 🎉

Your roadmap app has been successfully migrated from static mock data to Supabase database.

## ✅ What's Been Done

### 1. Database Migration File Created
- `supabase/migrations/003_insert_existing_projects.sql` - Contains all your existing 14 projects

### 2. App Updated to Use Supabase
- `src/app/page.tsx` has been completely refactored to:
  - Fetch projects from Supabase on page load
  - Save new projects to the database
  - Transform database data to app format
  - Show loading state while fetching

### 3. Key Changes
- ✅ Projects now load from database
- ✅ "Create Project" button saves to database
- ✅ Projects persist across page reloads
- ✅ All views (Gantt, Calendar, List, Kanban, Table) use real data

## 🚀 Next Steps (What YOU Need To Do)

### Step 1: Run the New Migration

Go to your Supabase dashboard and run the migration:

1. Open **SQL Editor** in Supabase
2. Click **New Query**
3. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/003_insert_existing_projects.sql`
4. Paste and click **Run**
5. You should see "Success" with 14 rows affected

### Step 2: Restart Your Dev Server

```bash
# Stop your current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test It Out!

1. **Load the app** - You should see all 14 existing projects
2. **Create a new project** - Click "Create Project" and add one
3. **Refresh the page** - The new project should still be there!
4. **Check the database** - Go to Supabase Table Editor → projects to see your data

## 📊 What's in the Database

Your database now contains:

### Reference Data (from migration 002):
- 5 Statuses: Not started, In progress, At risk, Done, Cancelled
- 5 Streams: Payments, Rewards, Growth, US, Mobile  
- 1 User: Product Team
- 3 Initiatives: Q4 2025, Q1 2026, Q2 2026
- 3 Releases: Q4 2025, Q1 2026, Q2 2026

### Project Data (from migration 003):
- 5 Payments projects (FX Pt 2, Xero Improvements, etc.)
- 5 Rewards projects (Member Benefits, Emirates Integration, etc.)
- 3 TBC projects (Growth, US, Mobile)
- **14 total projects**

## 🔍 Verify the Migration

### In Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **Table Editor**
2. Click on **projects** table
3. You should see 14 rows
4. Each project should have:
   - name, description
   - start_date, end_date
   - Linked status, stream, owner, initiative, release
   - progress percentage

### In Your App:

1. Open the roadmap at `http://localhost:3000`
2. You should see loading spinner briefly
3. Then all 14 projects appear in the Gantt chart
4. Filter by stream in the sidebar - projects should filter correctly
5. Click on any project - details dialog should show with all info

## 🎯 What Works Now

- ✅ View all projects in 5 different views
- ✅ Filter projects by stream (sidebar)
- ✅ Create new projects (saves to database)
- ✅ Click projects to view details
- ✅ Drag to move/resize projects (updates shown in console)
- ✅ Click "Today" marker to navigate timeline
- ✅ Data persists across page reloads
- ✅ All data stored in Supabase

## 🔄 What's Next (Future Enhancements)

Currently NOT implemented (but database-ready):
- Update/edit existing projects
- Delete projects (right-click menu exists, needs database hookup)
- Move project dates (drag feature needs database save)
- Real-time collaboration
- User authentication

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Loading roadmap..." never finishes
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `.env.local` has correct Supabase credentials
- Make sure you ran migrations 001, 002, and 003

### No projects showing up
- Check Supabase Table Editor - are there projects in the database?
- Did you run migration 003?
- Check browser console for API errors

### "Failed to create project"
- Check browser console for detailed error
- Verify RLS policies are set correctly in Supabase
- Make sure all reference data exists (statuses, streams, etc.)

## 📚 Files Changed

- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main app file, now uses Supabase
- `supabase/migrations/003_insert_existing_projects.sql` - New migration
- All other files remain unchanged

## 🎓 How It Works

1. **On Page Load**: App calls `getAllProjects()` to fetch from Supabase
2. **Transform Data**: Converts database format to app format using `transformProject()`
3. **Render**: All views use the transformed data
4. **Create Project**: Form collects data, calls `createProjectInDb()`, adds to local state
5. **Persistence**: Everything is saved in Supabase PostgreSQL database

## Summary

Your app is now **fully database-powered**! Just run the migration in Supabase, restart your dev server, and you're good to go. All your existing projects will be in the database and new projects will persist forever. 🚀
